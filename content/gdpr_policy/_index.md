### Social media cookies

We use social media platforms. Our profiles on Twitter, Facebook, Google, YouTube and LinkedIn communities strengthens our online presence and visibility.

The website does not set cookies with the display of links to our social media channels when you are browsing our website.
You can watch videos, which we upload (embed) to our YouTube page. You can also follow links from our website to social media platforms.

### Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses “cookies”, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States.

In case of activation of the IP anonymization, Google will truncate/anonymize the last octet of the IP address for Member States of the European Union as well as for other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to and shortened by Google servers in the USA.

On behalf of the website provider Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage to the website provider. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.

You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. However, we points out that if you do this, you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website.

### Opting out

By default, the browsing experience of website visitors is tracked by Google Analytics in order to produce anonymized statistics.

Furthermore you can prevent Google’s collection and use of data (cookies and IP address) by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en. Please note that on this website, Google Analytics code is supplemented by “gat._anonymizeIp();” to ensure an anonymized collection of IP addresses (so called IP-masking).
