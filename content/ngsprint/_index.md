Next year of NGSchool Society bring a new event - NGSprint!

It will be an online bioinformatics hackathon conducted by NGSchool members and friends, accompanied by a few lectures by renown researchers in the field. We will concentrate on various tasks around NGS data processing and analysis, as these were the topics most often mentioned in our recent survey. By the way, great thanks to all who give us the few minutes and filled it!

We are planning to form hackathon teams working on following topics:
1. RNAseq transcriptomics: from quality control to pathway analysis.
2. Multiomic data integration.
3. Cancer evolution.
4. New generation of biomarkers: miRNA and machine learning models.

Each team will be working on one topic for about a week under the guidance of mentor(s). At the end of the event, all teams will present the result of their work.

Participation in the hackhaton will require registration, while lectures will be open, available to wider audience.

Stay tuned, more details coming soon!
