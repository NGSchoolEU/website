### Topic

Summer School in Bioinformatics & NGS Data Analysis (#NGSchool2017) was held on 10-17 September 2017 in CBiES, Jachranka 81 k/Warszawy. 
In the course of one week, the participants attended the series of lectures and workshops, covering various aspects of computational biology, 
focusing on state-of-the-art techniques related to Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) and its application in research, health-care and industry. 
In 2017, we focused on data analysis from single-cell technologies. As before, the course covered wide range of topics, selected by popularity among attendees.
The materials are available on our [GitHub](https://github.com/NGSchoolEU/ngs17).
