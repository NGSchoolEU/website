It's our great pleasure to invite you to the **NGSymposium in Computational Biology** to celebrate the 5<sup>th</sup> edition of NGSchool Summer Schools. The conference will bring together early-stage and senior researchers from different areas of bioinformatics. It will take place on **the 23rd and 24th of September 2022 in Warsaw**, as a satellite event to the [NGSchool2022](/ngschool2022). 

This international conference will be an excellent platform for computational biologists in central and eastern Europe to present their work, discuss it with other participants and renowned invited speakers, as well as initiate potential collaborations.

## Topics and keywords
We will have panels on **multiomics and systems biology**, **cancer research**, **single cell transcriptomics** and **long-read sequencing**.

### For attendees from Russian institutions

NGSchool condemns the aggression against Ukraine in the strongest possible terms and stands in solidarity with our colleagues in Ukraine. Since Russian Universities publicly supported the war we are unable to accept participants affiliated with those institutions. However, we note that many Russian academics, at great personal peril, have publicly criticized this invasion. We would like to support all those harmed by Putin's regime and therefore extend our invitation to Russian academics and students provided they will come as individuals, without affiliation. We will not be able to accept payments for registration fees from Russian universities and companies and will not be able to provide receipts to those organizations.
