It's our great pleasure to invite you to the **NGSymposium in Computational Biology** to celebrate the 5<sup>th</sup> anniversary of NGSchool Summer Schools. The conference will bring together early-stage and senior researchers from different areas of bioinformatics. It will take place on **the 23rd and 24th of September 2022 in Warsaw**, as a satellite event to the [NGSchool2022](/ngschool2022). 

This international conference will be an excellent platform for computational biologists in central and eastern Europe to present their work, discuss it with other participants and renowned invited speakers, as well as initiate potential collaborations.

## Topics and keywords
We will have panels on multiomics and systems biology, cancer research, single cell transcriptomics and long-read sequencing. 

More details coming soon!

## Registration
Registration will be open on the 11th of April.

<!-- Countdown -->

<h2 id="demo"></h2>

<script>
// Set the date we're counting down to
var countDownDate = new Date("Sep 23, 2022 12:00:00").getTime();

// Update the count down every 1 second
var x = setInterval(function() {

  // Get today's date and time
  var now = new Date().getTime();

  // Find the distance between now and the count down date
  var distance = countDownDate - now;

  // Time calculations for days, hours, minutes and seconds
  var days = Math.floor(distance / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
  var hours = Math.floor((distance % (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)) / (1000 * 60 * 60));
  var minutes = Math.floor((distance % (1000 * 60 * 60)) / (1000 * 60));
  var seconds = Math.floor((distance % (1000 * 60)) / 1000);

  // Display the result in the element with id="demo"
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "NGSymposium starts in " + days + " days " + hours + " hours "
  + minutes + " min and " + seconds + " sec!";

  // If the count down is finished, write some text
  if (distance < 0) {
    clearInterval(x);
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "NGSymposium is here!";
  }
}, 1000);
