The [**NGSchool 2023:  Advances in Computational Biology**](/ngschool2023) is here! Below we present the report of how the applicants of the Summer School solved the questions and tasks set to them during the registration.

During the application process the applicants were asked to solve quiz questions evaluating their knowledge of biology, statistics and maths, as well as coding. Here is how all the applicants solved the questions and tasks:

You can check the correct answers [**here**](/post/solutions-ngschool2023).

This year we received three times more applications than the number of participants we can accommodate at the NGSchool. That, unfortunately, means that many well-qualified applicants could not be considered.  
Here is a visual summary of applications:

Even if you didn't get a spot this year, we hope to see you at one of our future events!
