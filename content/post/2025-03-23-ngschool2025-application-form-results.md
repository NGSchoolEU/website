The <a href="https://ngschool.eu/ngschool2025">NGSchool 2025: Sequencing Toolbox for Computational Biologists</a> is here! Below we present the report of how the applicants of the Summer School solved the questions and tasks set to them during the registration.

This year our scientific board evaluated over 350 applications, a record number of submissions. That, unfortunately, means that many well-qualified applicants could not be considered. Our registration form assessed the biological and statistical knowledge, programming skills and motivation of applicants. We greatly appreciate the high interest in this yearâ€™s event.

You can check the correct solutions to registration questions [**here**](/post/solutions-ngschool2025).

<b>Who are the accepted NGSchool2025 participants?</b>

The accepted applicants are residing in 16 different countries, with the majority of participants living in Poland, Germany, Czechia and Russia.

Almost half of NGSchool2025 participants are highly motivated PhD students and candidates. The participants come from a variety of scientific backgrounds from engineering and computational sciences to medical and experimental biology.
