As you know, our summer school NGSchool: Statistical Learning in Genomics has been moved to 2021, but.. don't worry! We cannot leave you with the thirst for knowledge. We are excited to invite you to a series of programming workshops focused around technologies used in bioinformatics. They will be mainly intended for people beginning their adventure with bioinformatics and computational biology, however we are sure that every participant will benefit from them.

Online workshops will be on Thursdays. Webinars will last about 1.5-2 hours. We are planning a live broadcast, and you will be able to ask questions. Recordings will be available later, but we encourage you to learn live.

The registration is not required as the streams will be accessible publicly on **[YouTube] (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5OFqeDkNKzMykBQqgd3Keg)**, however we invite you to our **[Discord server] (https://discord.gg/MhNeqwR)** to discuss the topics and ask the presenter your questions. The recordings will also be available on our YouTube channel afterwards.
