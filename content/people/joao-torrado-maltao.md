João is a Biomedicine and Computational Biology PhD student currently working between the Institute of Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Lisbon, and the Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science, Warsaw University. He is also a member of the Centre of Statistics and its Applications from the University of Lisbon. His previous studies were a BSc in Biology and a MSc in Biostatistics. He is interested in bioinformatics applications, autoimmunity, and diseases with complex diagnosis such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), a multifactorial illness with no biomarker and a heterogeneous affected population. For his recent research, he has been working with DNA methylation and gene expression data from ME/CFS patients to infer on population-related risks and using serology and immunological cellular compartments' data to study alternative cohort stratification and immunological profiling methods, dealing with the effects of misclassification trying to identify signatures for specific groups of patients
