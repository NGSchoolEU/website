Joanna Sulkowska is a Professor at University of Warsaw. Her group is interested in the development of multidimensional models for the analysis of energy landscape of proteins with complex structures and proteins with non-trivial topology, as well as in the development of analytical methods as direct coupling analysis (DCA). Her specific scientific interests include: 
 
* theoretical models of the energy landscape of proteins;
* analytical methods and bioinformatics tools to predict protein structures and folding mechanisms;
* mechanical properties of proteins, degradation and translation;
* protein ligand interactions, membrane proteins;
* applications of mathematical knot theory to proteins and nucleic acids.
