I am a PhD student at Bentzon Lab, currently working with single-cell technologies and data analysis. My Bachelor's and Master's education were in Medicine and Biochemistry, and I am a self-learner in Bioinformatics. Also, I am an enthusiast of the System Biology approach and apply it in our research of phenotypic modulation of cells in atherosclerosis.

My hobbies are hiking, traveling, rational thinking methods, video games, and my dog.
