I am a PhD student in Genomic Medicine and Statistics at the [Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics](https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/), [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/). I am supervised by [David Church](https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/people/david-church) and [David Wedge](https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/Team/david-wedge). 

I am interested in tumor heterogeneity, cancer genomics and epigenetics. For my DPhil project I am investigating chromatin organization role in tumor evolution in endometrial cancer. In my research I rely heavily on statistical machine learning. 

I am a President of the [NGSchool Society](/society). I am extremely happy to be able to work with such an amazing group of people. We are based all over Europe and US, and mostly communicate over Slack. Despite that we were able, not only to successfully realise countless projects, but also become close friends and build a sustainable community. We are always open to new additions to the team, so if you want to join in on the adventure be sure to [drop us a note](/contact)!

Before coming to Oxford I worked as a research assistant in the [Zebrafish Developmental Genomics group](https://zdglab.iimcb.gov.pl/) at the [International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology in Warsaw](https://www.iimcb.gov.pl/en/), and in [Ratan group](https://med.virginia.edu/faculty/faculty-listing/ar7jq/) at the [University of Virginia](https://med.virginia.edu/). I studied for BScEng and MSc in Biotechnology at the [Warsaw University of Technology in Poland](http://www.ch.pw.edu.pl/ch_en).
