I have a PhD in molecular biochemistry and went more into the direction of bioinformatics for my Postdoc. Now, I am the bioinformatician of our group, analysing all kinds of data produced by colleagues. We are investigating changes in the (epi)genome and genome stability of tumours and their microenvironment as well as during ageing.
