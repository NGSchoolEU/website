Jan’s group at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York develops and applies computational approaches for the integration of high-throughput multi-omic datasets to unravel the underlying aetiology of human disease, specifically diabetes, obesity, Alzheimer’s disease and cancer. The research he leads aims to understand complex metabolomic components of the disease and identify novel diagnostic markers and innovative therapeutic interventions. Before coming to New York, Jan worked at the Helmholtz Center Munich on identifying patient subgroups using molecular signatures derived from omics profiles. A method Jan worked on in collaboration with clinical colleagues is currently being evaluated in the Fr1da study - the largest population-based screening for type 1 diabetes in children launched in Bavaria in 2015.
