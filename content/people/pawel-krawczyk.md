Paweł is a postdoctoral researcher at the Laboratory of RNA Biology – ERA Chairs Group, International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology in Warsaw. During his PhD at the Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics in Warsaw, he worked on the metagenomic analysis of microorganisms from anthropogenic environments. At that time he got strongly interested in modern sequencing technologies and related bioinformatic analyses. After receiving PhD in 2018, he became a postdoctoral researcher in the laboratory led by prof. Andrzej Dziembowski, where he is involved in the projects focused on the analysis of functions of cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerases and the development of tools for the analysis of nanopore direct RNA sequencing data.
