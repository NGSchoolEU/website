A recent Biomedical Science graduate who has started a PhD in Computer Science at Durham University in collaboration with University of Liverpool looking to explore the applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP) on to a veterinary electronic health records (EHRs) dataset to explore antimicrobial usage patterns from across the UK. The move away from rule-based systems to neural networks enables a sensitivity for nuanced trends within the dataset and can capture a lifetime of events rather than acute disease leading to uncovering novel risk factors. I am also apart of ENOVAT, an EU commission to modernise veterinary antimicrobial usage guidelines and legislation across Europe.
