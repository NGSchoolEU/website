Kerstin Haase is a dedicated researcher at Charite Clinic, who joined the Henssen lab in October 2019, after her undergraduate degree in bioinformatics from the Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich (Germany) and PhD from the Technical University of Munich (Germany). Then, Kerstin joined the cancer genomics group at the Francis Crick Institute (London, UK) to characterize aberrations in cancer genomes as a part of the Pan-cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes. Currently, her primary objective is to investigate the role of circular DNA in tumour heterogeneity and evolution using advanced computational approaches applied to extensive sequencing datasets. Specifically, her research centres around comprehensively analyzing copy number variations (CNVs) within cancer genomes, with a focus on understanding their influence on the development of tumours.
