Gustav recently graduated with a PhD in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Gothenburg where he worked on stochastic modelling of glioblastoma growth and evolution. He is an expert in the mathematical modelling of complex and dynamic biological systems. His research interests focus on finding the representation of microscopic local phenomena and the effect it has on global behaviour, including how the individual behaviours of cancer cells affect the spatial growth and infiltration capacity of the tumour. The motivating principle behind his modelling is leveraging imaging data to make the most of large data sets using Bayesian methods and models.
