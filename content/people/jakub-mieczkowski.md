Jakubâ€™s group at the Medical University of Gdansk pursues multi-disciplinary projects aiming to uncover patterns in epigenetic factors influencing chromatin states and gene expression profiles relating to cellular responses to environmental stimulations in the context of their genetic, epigenetic and environmental background. The research he leads focuses on using high-throughput computational and experimental approaches to study cell transitions, and cell-cell communications and interrogate changes in chromatin structure and gene expression regulation triggered by genetic modifications and/or extracellular stimulations, particularly in cancer cells to provide diagnostic and therapeutic solutions.
