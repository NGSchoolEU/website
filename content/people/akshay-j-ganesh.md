I am currently doing my PhD at the Gene Regulation of Cell Identity Lab in IDIBELL, Barcelona. My work involves analysing single-cell transcriptomics data to understand the gene regulatory cascades involved in the onset of Alzheimer's Disease.
Outside of the lab, I am involved in science communication and play badminton. I also like ice cream.
