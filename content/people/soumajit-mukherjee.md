Currently, I work as a Post-doctoral Research Associate at the Department of Infectious Diseases at Kingâ€™s College London. My work involves studying host-pathogen interactions, and viral lifecycles and identifying host factors that aid the virus replication and consider myself a molecular virologist. I also use bioinformatics to analyze RNA-seq data regarding the effect of antiviral drug molecules on animal health. When not saving the world with pipettes and gels, I find myself playing guitar, reading books, or just napping with a dog.
