Fabiola is a postdoctoral researcher working on the application of  Machine Learning techniques in the context of computational biology. Her research focuses on the comprehensive integration of multimodal single-cell data and leveraging deep learning methods to identify multicellular programs in large single-cell collections. Before coming to Munich, she was working as a bioinformatician at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics at the University of Oxford on a variety of applications of single-cell sequencing in biology and medicine. While at Oxford, Fabiola contributed to the COvid-19 Multi-omics Blood ATlas (COMBAT) Consortium study that defined hallmarks of COVID-19 disease severity and specificity.
