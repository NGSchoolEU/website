Dr. Mireya Plass studied a BS in Biology (2005) and holds a PhD in Health and Life Sciences (2011) from Pompeu Fabra University (Barcelona, Spain). She pursued postdoctoral training abroad first at the University of Copenhagen (Krogh Lab, 2011-2015) and later at the Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology (N. Rajewsky Lab, 2016-2019) before returning to Spain to complete her post-doctoral training at the Center for Genomic Regulation with a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellowship (Irimia Lab, 2019). In 2019, she joined the CMRB (now P-CMRC) as independent group leader and shortly after she was awarded a Ram√≥n y Cajal contract from MINECO to support her position as principal investigator.

Throughout her career, Dr. Plass has been interested in understanding how post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, such as splicing and alternative polyadenylation, shape gene expression from an evolutionary and systems biology perspective. Recently, her work has pioneered the use of single-cell transcriptomics to understand how gene expression drives cellular differentiation. As independent group leader, she wants to investigate the function of post-transcriptional regulation in gene expression and cell differentiation, and in particular its contribution to the developm ent of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases.
