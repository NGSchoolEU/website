He holds a PhD in Biomedicine and Masters degrees in Bioinformatics and Mathematics and has experience in various fields of medical bioinformatics. He is working on the analysis of big genomics data (large cohorts of whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing), both in diagnostics and research. German previously worked on development of statistical methods for copy-number variants (CNVs) detection from NGS data. He took part in The Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) consortium, and recently has been leading a CNV analysis team of the Solve-RD consortium.
