Hi! I am a proactive self-learner with a degree in Genomic Biotechnology. Driven by the beauty and precision of biological data and the complexity of genomic material, I chose to further my career in bioinformatics, focusing on whole-genome analysis and precision medicine through projects in both academia and industry.<br>
My journey has been shaped by the generosity of many bioinformaticians who have shared their knowledge in accessible and often selfless ways. Inspired by this, I have dedicated part of my time to promoting bioinformatics, particularly in Latin America. This effort began with a collaborative project called ATGenomics and now continues as part of NGSociety. I hope NGSchool will provide you as much value as it has given me. Welcome!
