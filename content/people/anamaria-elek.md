I’m a PhD student at [Centre for Genomic Regulation](https://www.crg.eu/) in Barcelona, Spain, in the [group of Arnau Sebé Pedrós](https://www.sebepedroslab.org/). I am working on gene regulation and cell type evolution of early metazoans. On a day-to-day basis, this implies analyzing single cell transcriptomics and chromatin profiling data, with the focus on transcription factors, motifs and gene regulatory networks modeling.  

I joined the NGSchool family as a master student attending the summer school in 2018, and this turned out to be one of the few events that defined my scientific path. I later joined the organizing team in 2020, with the wish to contribute in any way I can to the initiative that was important for me, so that it can be as amazing, helpful and inspiring for others as well.
