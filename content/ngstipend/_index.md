We are starting a fellowship program called "**NGStipend**", which aims to match early-career researchers with NGSchool society mentors for a short-term project of 2-3 months. We also aim to provide financial support for the students during the short project duration. 

For the <u>2022-2023 pilot program</u>, we prioritized NGSchool2022 applicants who currently live in Ukraine. After contacting potential mentors, we matched one pair to complete a project from December 2022 to February 2023. We are committed to supporting the student for the duration of the project. 

A detailed description of the pilot fellowship can be found here:
