### Aakrosh Ratan
#### University of Virginia, USA  
  
Aakrosh is an Assistant Professor at the University of Virginia Public Health Sciences and the Center for Public Health Genomics. His research is focused on  studying genomic variation and genetic diversity and its consequences on species health and survival. He is a part of the GenomeAsia100K Consortium, a major Asian gene study initiative focusing on boosting our knowledge about medical genomics, understanding human migration and origins, as well as decreasing under-representation of Asian populations in genetic studies.

### Roser Vento-Tormo
#### Wellcome Sanger Institute, Cambridge, UK  
    
Roser leads a research team at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, focusing on the adaptation of immune cells in tissues and their function in steady state and inflammation. Her group aims to understand the influence of cellular microenvironments on individual cellular identities and responses, by employing single-cell genomics and spatial transcriptomics methods for reconstructing heterogenous immune environments, differentiation pathways and lineage hierarchies. Her lab is a part of the Developmental Atlas initiative in partnership with the Human Cell Atlas.

### Christopher Yau
#### University of Manchester & Alan Turing Institute, UK   
  
Chris is a Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Manchester and a Fellow at the Alan Turing Institute. For many years, he has been interested in the development of novel statistical methods for solving a broad spectrum of biomedical problems from microscopy to genomics to mental health. Real problems inspired and underpin the methodological research he does and getting to grips with real scientific investigations and experiments grounds the research in reality.
