In 2022 NGSchool, our flagship annual event, will come back! We hope that it will be possible to finally organize an in-person event, then. We miss you and the unique atmosphere of NGSchools. In the meantime, we would be grateful if you answered a few questions in our survey so that we know what topic interest you.

<a href="https://forms.gle/E2upreRC78xW3KUS7" class="btn btn-info btn-lg btn-block" style="width: 40%; margin: 0 auto;" target="blank">Register your interest form &nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-share-square"></i></a>

<br>
It is not a registration form yet, but we ask you to do it, because we want to know what you are the most interested in so that we can plan an event that you actually need.

<br>

Don't miss our events this year! More details coming soon.
