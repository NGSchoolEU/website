  title : "Why establishing the Society?"
  content : "To regulate formal aspects of our activity, we established NGSchool Society 
in late 2018. As a Society, it's easier for us to foster long lasting 
partnerships with scientific institutions and industry, invite experts 
in relevant topics to our events and improve based on feedback from events' participants.
     
     
Our organization's aim is to **support science**, with emphasis on computational 
biology and to strengthen the bioinformatics community. We organise training 
events, disseminate valuable **resources like video-recordings and tutorials** 
and much more. To learn about our work check-out the info about our ongoing 
and past projects.

For fiscal information (like Tax ID and Bank Account Number) see [here](../contact).
