  NGSchool (Next Generation School) is a platform to share the expertise in the field of Next Generation Sequencing Data Analysis 
  and general Bioinformatics. We organize activities aimed at young researchers, primarily from Central & Eastern European countries and 
  with at least basic background in biology/math/informatics, who strive to improve their Bioinformatics and NGS data analysis skills.
  
  
  So far we have organised 4 summer schools and co-organised number of local and satellite events. 
  
  
  Summer School is our flagship annual event. In addition, we are organising number of local events, such as workshops, symposiums and conferences."

  title : "We decided to make a difference."
  content : " 
  As many great things in life, #NGSchool started from a hangout and discussion over a beer with a bunch of friendly people.  
  
  
  The idea was born over lunch in Bratislava, back in summer 2015.  
  
  
  The initial motivation behind #NGSchool was to organise excellent & affordable training in Bioinformatics 
  for young, talented scientists. While there were many great hands-on courses in Bioinformatics at the time, 
  all of them were expensive, especially for researchers from Central & Eastern European countries.
  
  
  We decided to make a difference."

      for people that can’t afford to pay for it. Motivated by significant disproportion in resources and opportunities 
      available to researchers in Western and Central/Eastern Europe, our goal is to level these differences by providing
      affordable training specifically aimed at talented students and early stage researchers working in CEE countries."

      content : "Our mission is to deliver effective hands-on training and help young researchers develop important 
      computational and analytical skill for conducting state-of-the-art biological analyses. Therfore, every year we adapt 
      the course programme accordingly to accommodate new trends and developments in sequencing technologies, while addressing 
      new challenges arising in Bioinformatics and NGS data analysis. Our events are also aimed at initiating collaborations 
      that will advance the research and industry in these particular fields."

    - name : "Approach"
      content : "The previous editions of NGSchool were a big success and their popularity motivated us to organise 
      this summer school on an annual basis. On top of that, we are also organising related conferences and workshops.
      In order to regulate formal aspects of our activity and secure flawless organisation of future events, 
      we’ve established NGSchool Society. As a Society, we colaborate with many organizations in related fields,  
      invite experts in relevant topics to our events and improve based on feedback from events' participants."
