<p>I’m a PhD student in (Nephrolab)[https://www.kidneyresearchcenter.org/] at (CECAD)[https://www.cecad.uni-koeln.de/home/] Research Centre in Cologne, Germany. In my project, I study the role of long non-coding RNA in the pathogenesis of Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), a histological pattern of the kidney’s filtering units (glomeruli) injury causing serious scarring that leads to permanent kidney damage.</p>

<p>Before moving to Cologne, I took my Master’s degree in Biology with a specialization in Genetics and Experimental Biology at the University of Wrocław, and then for 2 years I was working in the Laboratory of Genomics and Bioinformatics at the Institute of Polish Academy of Science in Wrocław, Poland.</p>

<p>In the NGSchool Society I take care of the NGSchool events promotion online through preparing graphics and posting on our social media. I try to reach people from various communities and introduce them to our training materials, events and projects.</p>
