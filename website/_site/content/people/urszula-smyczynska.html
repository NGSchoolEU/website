<p>I graduated in biomedical engineering from Lodz University of Technology, Lodz, Poland (2013) and AGH University of Science and Technology, Cracow, Poland (2014). I’ve got  PhD title in biocybernetics and biomedical engineering in 2018 from The Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Automatics, Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering of AGH University of Science and Technology. During my graduate and PhD studies I worked on the applicability of artificial neural networks to the prediction of growth hormone treatment efficiency in short-stature children.
Currently, I work at the <a href="https://biostat.umed.pl">Department of Biostatistics and Translational Medicine</a> at the <a href="https://en.umed.pl/">Medical University of Lodz</a>, Poland, on projects in biostatistics, bioinformatics and medical informatics, including biomedical data analysis and design of healthcare IT systems.</p>
