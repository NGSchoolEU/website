<p>I am a PhD candidate at the Medical University of Bialystok, Poland, under a Marie-Sklodowska Curie Actions PhD program (ImPRESS). My PhD advisor is prof. dr hab. Adam Krętowski. My PhD project is to develop prediction models for bariatric surgery outcomes using multi-omics data and machine learning. I am also a graduate intern at the Institute for Systems Biology, USA, from February to August 2021. My internship advisor is Asst. Prof. Jennifer Hadlock, MD. For this internship, I am involved in a study predicting COVID-19 outcomes using machine learning. 
I completed my Bachelor of Science degree in Microbiology at the Bandung Institute of Technology, Indonesia in 2012. After graduation, I worked as a research assistant at the Mochtar Riady Institute for Nanotechnology, a non-profit cancer research institute in Indonesia. In 2015, I was awarded a Fulbright scholarship for a Master’s degree in Human Genetics at the Virginia Commonwealth University, USA. I graduated in 2017 and returned to Indonesia to work as a research assistant at the Bandung Institute of Technology. I moved to Poland in 2018 to pursue my doctoral degree.</p>
