<p>I’m a PhD student at <a href="https://www.crg.eu/">Centre for Genomic Regulation</a> in Barcelona, Spain, in the <a href="https://www.sebepedroslab.org/">group of Arnau Sebé Pedrós</a>. I am working on gene regulation and cell type evolution of early metazoans. On a day-to-day basis, this implies analyzing and interpreting single cell transcriptomics and chromatin profiling data, with the focus on TF usage, motifs and gene regulatory networks. 
I joined the NGSchool family as a master student attending the summer school in 2018, and this turned out to be one of the few events that defined my later scientific path. I later joined the organizing team in 2020, with the wish to contribute in any way I can to the initiative that was so important for me, so that it can be as amazing, helpful and inspiring for others as well.</p>
