                <p>
                    Sequencing technologies have revolutionized the biological sciences, allowing researchers to gain unprecedented insights into the genetic and molecular underpinnings of life. With the rise of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and long-read sequencing technologies, scientists can now uncover complex genetic variations, structural rearrangements, and epigenetic modifications that were previously undetectable. These advancements are transforming fields like personalized medicine, agriculture, and environmental science, with far-reaching implications for global health and sustainability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At NGSchool2025, you'll have the chance to learn from experts in the field, engage in hands-on workshops, and collaborate with like-minded peers from around the world. Our program is tailored to the educational needs of  participants from the Visegr√°d Four (V4) and Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) regions but welcomes aspiring computational biologists and bioinformaticians from all backgrounds.

                    The deadline to submit your application is <b>23.12.2024 at 23:59 UTC</b>. Selection results will be announced at the end of January. If you have any question or problems get in touch via email: <a href="mailto: info@ngschool.eu">info@ngschool.eu</a>.

                <h3>Registration fee</h3>
                <p>
                    The registration fee for the selected participants is <b>180 EUR/820 PLN for academia</b> and <b>400 EUR/1840 PLN for industry</b>. This fully covers the costs of accommodation and boarding during the school. <br>
                    We try to make our events accessible and affordable for all and keep the registration fees to a minimum. However, we understand that in some circumstances covering the costs of participation in our event can still be challenging. We do not want money to be a limiting factor in anyone's participation, so we will provide financial support for several selected participants, primarily based on their socioeconomic status. We can offer two types of support:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul style="color: #7b7b7b">
                        <li>Travel grant to help you cover the cost of your travel to the event's venue.</li>
                        <li>Fee discount or waiver directed to those participants who cannot get the fee covered by their institutions.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <span style="color: #7b7b7b">
                        Both types of support will be preferentially grated to participants from academia (students, PhD candidates and faculty stuff), but application from industry will be considered, too. If you wish to be considered for travel grant, fee discount/waiver or both, make sure to fill the Bursary section of the application form, explaining your situation. We will try our best to help you.

                    <p>NGSchool condemns the aggression against Ukraine in the strongest possible terms and stands in solidarity with our colleagues in Ukraine. Since Russian Universities publicly supported the war we are unable to accept participants affiliated with those institutions. However, we note that many Russian academics, at great personal peril, have publicly criticized this invasion. We would like to support all those harmed by Putin's regime and therefore extend our invitation to Russian academics and students provided they will come as individuals, without affiliation. We will not be able to accept payments for registration fees from Russian universities and companies and will not be able to provide receipts to those organizations.</p>
