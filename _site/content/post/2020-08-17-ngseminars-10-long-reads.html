<p>Andrey Prjibelski graduated from St. Petersburg Academic University, Russia, in 2012 with MScin software engineering and informatics. Andrey is currently employed as a research fellow in the Center of Algorithmic Biotechnology, St. Petersburg University, where he started his career as an intern back in 2011. In 2020 Andrey defended his PhD thesis entitled “Algorithms for genome and transcriptome assembly”. His current interests include transcriptomics, genomics and sequencing data analysis in its different forms.</p>

<p>While in genomic studies third generation sequencing technologies already became an everyday instrument, their usage in transcriptomic projects just starts to gain popularity.Although PacBio and Oxford Nanopores are capable of sequencing almost every mRNA molecule from end to end, analysis of such data is not trivial, mostly due to the high error rates.</p>

<p>In this talk I will give a brief introduction into long-read RNA sequencing, what kind of analysis is possible using such data, what bioinformatics challenges remain unsolved and how do we try to address them in our new tool called IsoQuant. Mostly, this talk is about the algorithms we design and technical solutions, but some biological remarks may also be included.</p>
